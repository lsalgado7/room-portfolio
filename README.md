# 🌲 3D Interactive Portfolio

I made this portfolio to have a digital home where I can showcase my skills while learning creative 3D web development. This project features a custom-modeled & interactive 3D room.

## 🚀 Overview

I created two distinct features for this project:

1. **The Landing Interface:** A professional "resume-style" dashboard providing a high-level overview of my education at the **University of Oregon**, professional experience, and technical proficiencies.
2. **The 3D Experience:** A fully interactive 3D environment modeled in **Blender** and rendered using **Three.js**, allowing users to explore my personality and interests in a spatial context.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

### **Frontend & 3D Engine**

* **Three.js:** Powers the 3D rendering and scene management.
* **Vanilla JavaScript:** Core logic for scene interaction, raycasting, and modal management.
* **Sass (SCSS):** Advanced styling using modular components and modern Dart Sass color functions.
* **GSAP:** High-performance animations for the "shrink and drop" landing page reveal and model animations.

### **Design & Tools**

* **Blender:** Used for custom 3D modeling and baking.
* **Vite:** Fast build tool and development server.
